# Typescript Remote Procedure Call

## Introduction

Hi, awesome Fullstack Developer!

Always wanted to have a fully type safe api? <br>
Have you ever had the need to create an api that communicates flawlessly with any frontend?

It's always a hassle to communicate when we speak different languages. Duh! üòÖ <br>
This repository shows the power of fullstack applications written in the same language.

No more **miscommunication**, no more clunky **type generation**, no more **messing around with different docs**, move away from **multiple date specs** that belong to a specific language, **rely on a REAL fullstack app** where all your code and logic move together on delivery.

Rest assured, `TRPC` and `Typescript` are here to save your ass, üéâ <br>and to speed things up a bit! üèéÔ∏è

## TRPC

You can find everything you need to know about [trpc here](https://trpc.io/). We wont be documenting anything about the library here since they have a decent doc on their own. Their selling points are:

- Automatic typesafety
- Snappy DX
- Framework agnostic
- Autocompletion
- Light bundle size
- Batteries included

Also checkout their [vocabulary](https://trpc.io/docs/concepts#vocabulary).

## The Examples

To make sure we want to cover a large surface of BE and FE configurations we need to mimic their real life situations.

But, let's start slow. We start with some basic examples, then after that we'll be building up to real life examples.
